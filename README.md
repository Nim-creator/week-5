Theoretical Analysis
Q1: How AI Code Generation Tools Reduce Dev Time
AI tools like GitHub Copilot assist developers by suggesting entire lines or blocks of code based on natural language prompts and context. They reduce the time spent on boilerplate or repetitive tasks.
Limitations:
May produce insecure or incorrect code.

Relies heavily on training data and may not understand specific project needs.

Needs human review and testing.

Q2: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning for Bug Detection
Supervised learning uses labeled data (bug vs. no bug) to train a model to detect known bugs.

Unsupervised learning finds unknown patterns or anomalies without labeled data, useful for new or unexpected bugs.

Example: Clustering logs to detect suspicious behavior.

Q3: Bias in Personalization AI
If AI is trained on data from only one user group, it may personalize unfairly for others. This could exclude minorities or reinforce stereotypes.
Bias mitigation ensures inclusive UX, fairness, and ethical compliance.

Case Study: AIOps in DevOps
AIOps automates log analysis and system monitoring, improving deployment by:

Predicting failures and auto-scaling resources.

Detecting root causes faster than humans.

Examples:

Auto-restart crashed services.

Predict traffic spikes and allocate bandwidth.
